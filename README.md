# Marginal Plots

A simple project showing what marginal plots are and showing how to create them using **Python** (Seaborn, Matplotlib) and **R** (ggplot2, ggExtra).

Marginal plots enrich scatterplots with additional visualizations (histograms, density curves, boxplots) along the margins to show the distribution of each variable.
